My name is Konstantin, I am a freelance software designer and developer. If you have a project or an idea for a website then I can help you.</p><p>I offer professional web design, web application development and Internet marketing services for small businesses and individuals. These services are detailed below. Please visit the <a href=\"/projects\">projects</a> section for samples of my work.</p><ul class=\"content\"><li><h3>User-Centered Design</h3><p>I believe that professional web design is about building highly functional web sites, optimized for simplicity of use, feature discoverability and accessibility. Designing user interfaces that look beautiful but are hard to use does not make your site attractive to its visitors. Making the intended users feel productive while visiting your site is the key to making them stay around.</p><p>I plan user requirements into your project right from the start, and evaluate them at each stage of the development cycle, including site maintenance after launch.</p></li><li><h3>Website Development and Maintenance</h3><p>I specialize in web development with Python programming language. In my development process I utilize Rapid Application Development tools such as <a href=\"http://www.djangoproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Django</a> web application framework and technologies created by the <a href=\"http://www.pylonsproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Pylons Project</a>.</p><p>Of course, I realize that the choice of tools greatly depends on the task at hand. I see tools only as a means to achieve goals, and I choose the set of technologies that is best for your project.</p><p>My aim is to develop long term partnerships with my clients by providing on-going support and further development of their websites. I write robust, well thought out code, that tends to be defect-free. If you find a bug in my existing code, I will happily fix it for no charge for as long as your site is running.</p></li><li><h3>Search Engine Optimization and Marketing</h3><p>The most reliable strategy for making your site visible in search engines is to provide quality content. I consider several factors when optimizing your site for search engines: relevance of content, presence of descriptive keywords, and content freshness. I also make sure that the structure of the underlying HTML code and your site's overall architecture help search engines index your site effectively.</p><p>In addition, I have expertise to increase your site's visibility in social networks. I can integrate your site with social media solutions such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google+.</p></li></ul><p>If you would like to talk about your project, or to find out more about my services and the process, please feel free to get in <a href=\"{% url contact %}\">contact</a> with me. Thank you!</p>", "enable_comments": false}}, {"pk": 2, "model": "flatpages.flatpage", "fields": {"registration_required": false, "title": "about", "url": "/about/", "template_name": "", "sites": [1], "content": "<p>Hello! Thank you for visiting.</p><p>I am Konstantin Sushenko, a freelance software developer with a Master of Science degree in Computer Science and many years' experience as a software design engineer. I have worked with various technologies, both proprietary and open source, and I have completed several types of software release life cycles ranging from desktop applications, through to websites and web applications.</p><p>I specialize in web development with dynamic languages such as Python. My expertise goes beyond the mere knowledge of syntax and of popular libraries, and I know how to build high quality robust software by devising the right algorithms and by the appropriate use of technology.</p><p>I pride myself on my attention to detail and on my ability to find creative solutions to practical problems. When designing your website, I think beyond the obvious and find ways to grow your web presence.</p><p>Outside of software development, my interests are primarily in art. I have been practising as a visual artist throughout my life in a variety of media.
